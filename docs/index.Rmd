We are recruiting postdoc and PhD student positions for an NSF-funded project on the patterns and mechanisms of ecosystem size spectra across macroecological gradients. The anticipated start date would be in Spring/Summer 2026. Formal announcements are forthcoming, but if you are interested contact:

James Junker [james.junker[at]unt.edu](mailto:james.junker@unt.edu) for the PhD student position

Jeff Wesner [jeff.wesner[at]usd.edu](mailto:jeff.wesner@usd.edu) for the postdoc position

# Welcome

Extended resources for Junker, JR, R. McClure, J. Pomeranz, J. Wesner, B. Murry. *Use of size spectra as a holistic indicator of change for fisheries and ecosystem management*. Poster #46. AFS 2025 Annual Conference.[LINK](Junker_AFS2025_Poster.pdf)


Are you interested in the application of size spectra to ecosystem and fisheries management? See details.

The ISD arises from multiple theories in ecology and has potential as a universal
indicator. However, our understanding of the macroecology of the ISD is limited, as most studies
have been limited to small spatial or temporal scales. Multiple
agencies routinely collect these data (e.g., NEON, LTER, fisheries agencies, etc.), but it is not
currently possible to analyze macroecological or temporal trends in size spectra because the data
have not been compiled and harmonized. Gathering these data will allow ecologists to quantify
spatial and temporal variation in size-abundance scaling across freshwater ecosystems and to test
theory-driven hypotheses for how that scaling responds to fisheries management decisions (e.g., changing regulations and harvest, stocking) and natural and anthropogenic change (e.g., species invasions, eutrophication, warming). 

***** Are you a manager of fisheries data that collects body size information? Would you like to use size spectra as a potential management metric? *****

We are assessing the interest in broader use of size spectra for understanding and managing inland fisheries. This might include workshops at conferences like AFS, shared learning resource collections, web portals to automate analysis of community size spectra, or other opportunities for data syntheses.

If you are interested, please reach out to [james.junker[at]unt.edu](mailto:james.junker@unt.edu).
